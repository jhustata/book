    "Lets recap the last 7 weeks in the spirit of a [coda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coda_(music)):\n",
    "\n",
    "* `help`\n",
    "   * the help command followed by any command you wish to further explore \n",
    "   * e.g., `h twoway`\n",
    "\n",
    "* `tokenize`\n",
    "   * represent a numerical sequence (e.g. 1,2,3,...,6)  \n",
    "   * as a sequence of letters (e.g. a,b,c,...,z or A,B,C,...,Z)\n",
    "\n",
    "* `quietly`\n",
    "   * how to control what is displayed in the Stata terminal\n",
    "   * Stata uses this e.g. with the neat regression output, and with profile.do\n",
    "   * may very easily be changed to `noisily` if that suits your needs\n",
    "\n",
    "* `delimit`\n",
    "   * neat way to mimic `SAS` in defining the end of **one \"line\" of code**\n",
    "   * especially useful when dealing with graphical output and numerous graphing options\n",
    "   * absolutely necessary if ever you wish to translate `.SAS` code into `.do`\n",
    "   * may make accessible what otherwise were inaccessible datasets (e.g. [NHANES](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=nhanes))\n",
    "\n",
    "* `rnormal()`\n",
    "   * simulating parametric distributions\n",
    "   * you may develop this idea on your own in the future\n",
    "   * `runiform()` & `rnormal()` are the only examples demonstrated in this class\n",
    "\n",
    "* `pwd`\n",
    "   * pwd\n",
    "   * di c(pwd)\n",
    "   * di \"text with embedded `c(pwd)' for whatever reason\"\n",
    "   * global filepath c(pwd)\n",
    "\n",
    "* `r(mean)`\n",
    "   * creturn list\n",
    "   * return list\n",
    "   * ereturn list\n",
    "\n",
    "* `by`\n",
    "   * collapse (`statistic`) varname1 by(varname2)\n",
    "   * egen varname1=`statistic`(varname2)\n",
    "   * above commands are **equivalent** in many regards\n",
    "   * one distorts the data; the other doesn't do so at all\n",
    "   * useful created twoway plots or other graphical output\n",
    "\n",
    "* `program define`\n",
    "   * rigid, specific programs (without `syntax varlist` or `syntax, options`)\n",
    "   * flexible, generalizable programs (with `syntax [varlist]`, `[options]`)\n",
    "\n",
    "* `capture`\n",
    "   * preventing error results and an arrested script\n",
    "   * Stata is finicky, *pernickety* and this little preface to a command may spare you untold misery\n",
    "   * we've used it most frequently before `program define` & `log using`\n",
    "   * but, notably, we've used it as a parsimonous variant in `syntax varlist if`\n",
    "\n",
    "* `twoway`\n",
    "   * last weeks class, which we didn't cover because of `hw1`-related issues\n",
    "   * notes have been updated to give you the best bang for your buck \n",
    "   * lookout for the following **very** important issues:\n",
    "     * workflow;\n",
    "     * open science; and,\n",
    "     * chatGPTs take on these.\n",
    "\n",
    "* on your own, please go walk step-by-step, command-by-command, through the `twoway` examples offered\n",
    "\n",
    "* think about `if macro {` conditional code-blocks and your deployment of this artifice in future, very powerful Stata scripts!\n",
    "\n",
    "Today we'll circle back to the method emplyed throughout this class:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * defining macros\n",
    "   * formatting them\n",
    "   * [embedding](https://jhustata.github.io/book/ggg.html) them in strings, text, figures, and excel\n",
    "   * producing aesthically pleasing, richly informative output\n",
    "\n",
    "But to what end?\n",
    "\n",
    "   * the advanced Stata Programming class answers that question thus:\n",
    "       * open science\n",
    "       * self-publication\n",
    "       * collaboration\n",
