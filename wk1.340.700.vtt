1
00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:08.360
Abimereki Muzaale: Welcome once again to advanced state of programming.

2
00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:23.730
Abimereki Muzaale: I apologize for not having recorded our first session on Tuesday. So this is going to be a brief video that's just gonna highlight the points I made, and also just to give you a little more support towards your week's task.

3
00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:30.440
Abimereki Muzaale: So to recap

4
00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:44.130
Abimereki Muzaale: a lot of the chorus. Content is going to be embedded in this book, which is share with 3 4,600 class. A few of you are enrolled in that class. So that's not a problem.

5
00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:53.620
Abimereki Muzaale: a reminder that your ta is here.

6
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.120
Abimereki Muzaale: So 3, 4,700. You have, Jason.

7
00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:01.860
Abimereki Muzaale: and then Monday

8
00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:09.760
Abimereki Muzaale: you'll have office hours between 3, 30 and 4 30. Jason says that this is a great opportunity

9
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:24.460
Abimereki Muzaale: to you know. Talk about the week's task before the class on Tuesday. It's not going to be hard deadlines with this class. It's going to be like a seminar, you know. Just think of it as a seminar on numbers a small

10
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.960
Abimereki Muzaale: and so there'll be a little more intimate interaction.

11
00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.100
Abimereki Muzaale: So if your task is now ready by

12
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:50.580
Abimereki Muzaale: by the next class, your main disadvantage will be that we'll be giving you another task. So you have 2 tasks. Then, if you keep accumulating tasks, you not benefit as much as the rest of your classmates, so try to do as much as you can, but don't spend too much time. Don't feel stuck

13
00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:56.030
because it's only one credit unit, and Don't spend too much time. Just go to the discussion for

14
00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:10.419
Abimereki Muzaale: and raise some questions. I I even posted something yesterday because on the discussion Forum, because no one had posted anything yet. I've spoken with some of you, and you're having a hard time with the assignment.

15
00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:12.000
Abimereki Muzaale: So that means

16
00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:21.840
Abimereki Muzaale: that the discussion for is not being used, or you're too shy to share your concerns, but should not be shy. There's nothing to gain from that.

17
00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:36.320
Abimereki Muzaale: so that's it. Every week is going to be a task. And if we look back at here at the syllabus. I what did we promise to give you

18
00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:42.270
Abimereki Muzaale: advanced data, syntax? You gonna get that? Yeah.

19
00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.140
Abimereki Muzaale: something about simulations. You're going to get that

20
00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.180
Abimereki Muzaale: powerful and flexible programs

21
00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:58.780
Abimereki Muzaale: to automate analytic tasks. You're going to get that. The first assignment is actually pushing it in that direction

22
00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:12.200
Abimereki Muzaale: of writing something actually very simple program, but automating a task of getting data sets from 1959 through to 2710 with just one of it. Just one loop, you know.

23
00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:22.240
Abimereki Muzaale: Optimize code for faster on time and memory. minimal memory to usage. Now, that is one of the key things this task is about.

24
00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:25.210
Abimereki Muzaale: It is about runtime.

25
00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.890
Abimereki Muzaale: It's about memory and the capability of your version of data.

26
00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:36.510
Abimereki Muzaale: Then a generating hypertext using data. So HTML late tech.

27
00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:45.660
Abimereki Muzaale: so we'll get into this. This. The things outline in the syllabus are things that we're going to achieve in a very very short time.

28
00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:57.680
Abimereki Muzaale: but I want you to be more fun, more engaging. I know you're new to the class. Some of you are very new to this kind of programming. So you were bold enough to sign up an advanced class. We just did you not regret it?

29
00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.090
Abimereki Muzaale: Okay, so let's just go

30
00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:11.400
Abimereki Muzaale: briefly over. I'm going to the 2 way. Chapter I wrote some notes for you here that you've got a task.

31
00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:19.649
Abimereki Muzaale: Use the resources available available to you. That's n we are national beer of economic research website

32
00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:22.830
Abimereki Muzaale: and

33
00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:29.930
Abimereki Muzaale: reproduce the plot that's shown under here some by right click, this you'll be able to see the plot here.

34
00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.820
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah.

35
00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:39.400
Abimereki Muzaale: So you just reproduce this, and it's a 2 way plot. Why is it 2? A.

36
00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:50.340
Abimereki Muzaale: Because it's just 2 variables involved this year? So you you values from 1,959 through 2,017. So that's one variable. and another variable is

37
00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:52.890
Abimereki Muzaale: number up. Yes.

38
00:04:53.830 --> 00:05:02.650
Abimereki Muzaale: so you can use a scatter plot. You can use whatever. I decided to use a line plot. There is a mistake in this figure.

39
00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:07.410
Abimereki Muzaale: I don't know if you guys can notice, but it should not bother anyone.

40
00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:11.700
Abimereki Muzaale: Okay.

41
00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:18.750
Abimereki Muzaale: Well. let's get back to the figure once again.

42
00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:25.980
Abimereki Muzaale: This scale is in millions, because if this is thousands

43
00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:38.840
Abimereki Muzaale: and there's a 1,000. That means there's a 1 million. It's about 1.6 million deaths. And here we about 2.8 million in 2710. So you're gonna be importing huge data sets.

44
00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:41.490
Abimereki Muzaale: and that is

45
00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:47.090
Abimereki Muzaale: going to address one of the things mentioned in the syllabus. Yeah.

46
00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:53.290
Abimereki Muzaale: it's got to deal with speed, runtime usage

47
00:05:53.580 --> 00:06:00.910
Abimereki Muzaale: and memory. And you know your data Capability is not your capability to the capability of your state of version?

48
00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:09.790
Abimereki Muzaale: Those are the things that are going to be put to test. Then we'll see how to get more efficient about this. Okay. Now.

49
00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:14.790
Abimereki Muzaale: I have shared what I think is very helpful.

50
00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:21.500
Abimereki Muzaale: This is code that even if you can't understand it. if you just copy

51
00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:25.300
Abimereki Muzaale: and paste it into a do file.

52
00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:33.920
Abimereki Muzaale: why should we call this new file? We're calling out log file week one

53
00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:39.430
Abimereki Muzaale: required for public health 340 dot 700.

54
00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:41.910
Abimereki Muzaale: I think that's a good name.

55
00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:47.490
Abimereki Muzaale: so we'll give that same name to our defile. save

56
00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:54.630
Abimereki Muzaale: that you I'm going to save my my desktop

57
00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:01.210
and

58
00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:04.590
Abimereki Muzaale: I'm: Good. Okay.

59
00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:14.300
Abimereki Muzaale: i'm going to run. So our notes are saying. But here's the data. This is the output one to

60
00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:23.210
Abimereki Muzaale: reproduce. And this is a hint, a hint as to how to reproduce that. And quite frankly, this is way more than a he pretty much

61
00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:26.020
Abimereki Muzaale: giving you the solution

62
00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:29.140
Abimereki Muzaale: a good ch of the solution.

63
00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:34.620
Abimereki Muzaale: So

64
00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:37.410
Abimereki Muzaale: i'm gonna hit 2.

65
00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:44.010
Abimereki Muzaale: I can either quick do here for.

66
00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:46.850
Abimereki Muzaale: because if I type

67
00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:51.080
Abimereki Muzaale: hewd

68
00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:58.090
Abimereki Muzaale: it should tell me my current working directory is my downloads.

69
00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:12.580
Abimereki Muzaale: but I just downloaded and let's see, is there anything in my downloads? This is a command. Good! It displays what's in your present work Directory is nothing. My downloads because I just

70
00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:17.350
Abimereki Muzaale: created a do file and saved it in my user my desktop.

71
00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:25.290
Abimereki Muzaale: Oh, good heavens! So change direct to me

72
00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:36.970
Abimereki Muzaale: All right now. I'm gonna check the contents. So we have one file in my desktop, and it's right there.

73
00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:42.250
Abimereki Muzaale: So I mean I have it right here. It's open so I can hit do.

74
00:08:43.299 --> 00:08:51.100
Abimereki Muzaale: But I just wanted to show you that I can actually just also write the command, do you? Who do?

75
00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:55.230
Abimereki Muzaale: I think I hit it twice?

76
00:08:57.030 --> 00:09:01.350
Abimereki Muzaale: Now, what's going on? Can you look at this progress bar at the bottom.

77
00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:03.970
Abimereki Muzaale: It's loading data

78
00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:09.450
Abimereki Muzaale: data from where.

79
00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:16.940
Abimereki Muzaale: since you can't read the code, maybe you can't. but I can point you to line

80
00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:19.440
Abimereki Muzaale: 14.

81
00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:25.380
Abimereki Muzaale: There is a URL. So

82
00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:31.660
Abimereki Muzaale: and you are all pointing to the national bureaucratic research website

83
00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:35.670
Abimereki Muzaale: specifically to information or mortality on that website.

84
00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:38.700
Abimereki Muzaale: And

85
00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:47.100
Abimereki Muzaale: if we look at line.

86
00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:55.030
Abimereki Muzaale: Oh, behold, if you look at line. I just wanted to point you to something that just happened.

87
00:09:55.180 --> 00:10:07.080
Abimereki Muzaale: If you look at my desktop and log file, you remember those just to do file. Now there's a log file and a data set that says year, or 1,900 and 59 that Dta.

88
00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:08.680
Abimereki Muzaale: Where do that come from?

89
00:10:10.090 --> 00:10:11.380
Abimereki Muzaale: I'll show you

90
00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:17.300
Abimereki Muzaale: i'll show you. There's a line 28

91
00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:23.430
Abimereki Muzaale: that says, save y I

92
00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:29.480
Abimereki Muzaale: see that I with the back quote. Then it for quote

93
00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:40.940
Abimereki Muzaale: we see here. It appears in pink. That is a local macro. Wherever you see it back, something in within back code a for quote

94
00:10:41.830 --> 00:10:49.750
Abimereki Muzaale: it's in my local Macro, behold another data says it just appeared popped up here. Why, 1,960 d

95
00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:52.810
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah. So that's again

96
00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:56.320
Abimereki Muzaale: line 28 over and over again. So there's a loop.

97
00:10:56.720 --> 00:11:10.440
Abimereki Muzaale: and the loop is right here. Yeah, for values. I so you're defining I. You can put anything, any letter here or any word. and then state it will be like, oh, you just to find a local macro

98
00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:17.880
Abimereki Muzaale: which has the values 1,959 through to 1,961, and then we open braces.

99
00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:37.670
Abimereki Muzaale: and we in Dent we see all this block of code is going to be run over and over for values 1959 until rich 61. So it's going to go with we've got in Why, 1,959. Why, 1,960 we're getting Why, 1,961 and that'd be it

100
00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:43.800
Abimereki Muzaale: so the command is use 1,961 done

101
00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:47.850
Abimereki Muzaale: output. So I witnessed that in real time.

102
00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:50.050
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah.

103
00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:53.880
Abimereki Muzaale: let's continue what we're saying.

104
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:56.970
Abimereki Muzaale: So the the do file is done. End up to file.

105
00:11:58.290 --> 00:12:03.160
Abimereki Muzaale: So let's just continue analyzing the one statement. Use something

106
00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:04.310
Abimereki Muzaale: clear.

107
00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:13.490
Abimereki Muzaale: So you you must be familiar with this, so use a URL. You can use it the URL, and it's in braces with the dollar sign.

108
00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:15.490
Abimereki Muzaale: Since the dollar sign.

109
00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:25.000
Abimereki Muzaale: That means it's a global macro. You define a global macro. We'll just we'll talk about Macros. You find a global microc called URL,

110
00:12:25.210 --> 00:12:28.700
Abimereki Muzaale: and the Dollar Sign tells data. Whatever follows here

111
00:12:29.450 --> 00:12:34.360
Abimereki Muzaale: Limited within braces is the global macro. So, Stata, is this reading?

112
00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:47.510
Abimereki Muzaale: Use that URL from, and the National Beer and Economic Research website and the URL continues it doesn't, Stop there, forward, slush.

113
00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:53.770
Abimereki Muzaale: I So that actually your is this for a slash.

114
00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:58.970
Abimereki Muzaale: I so I will be 1959 initially for slash mort

115
00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:06.240
Abimereki Muzaale: for a swush. if you Yes, more 1,959 dot bta.

116
00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:11.870
We didn't specify dt about state in those when you use the use statement

117
00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:24.610
Abimereki Muzaale: it's a died dta comma clear so it imports that the reason it's too long to pretty import 3 files because they're huge. Then look at this numbers. You know that's 1.6 million.

118
00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:31.510
Abimereki Muzaale: 1.7 million. So it was taken while loading each data set. It's a total over 5 million.

119
00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:43.200
Abimereki Muzaale: So it loads One data set, saves it as Why the year? Why 59, 1,959? Why 1,960? Why, 1,961, so it does one at a time.

120
00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:48.080
Abimereki Muzaale: and we have a timer. Yeah, it's timing this stuff

121
00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:51.710
Abimereki Muzaale: when it started, and when it ended, so it gets here

122
00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:53.120
Abimereki Muzaale: and loops back.

123
00:13:54.110 --> 00:13:57.900
Abimereki Muzaale: So 59 does everything. I is 59

124
00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:06.430
Abimereki Muzaale: where it finishes. I become 60 finishes. I become 61 and state it will know that's the last one. Then it goes down here

125
00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:11.080
Abimereki Muzaale: Here, there's another loop

126
00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:23.560
Abimereki Muzaale: here is again a loop. It says, Clear clear everything in the memory for values. I 1959 to 1,961

127
00:14:23.710 --> 00:14:30.130
Abimereki Muzaale: a PIN. So now you're not creating datas, they exist. They're right there and append

128
00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:45.570
Abimereki Muzaale: using 59, 66 to one. So that happens really fast. See that as more that U.S.A. So we can see a file here called more dot U.S.A.

129
00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:49.640
Abimereki Muzaale: I think I made a mistake in the code.

130
00:14:50.090 --> 00:14:53.970
Abimereki Muzaale: This should be more U.S.A.:

131
00:14:54.380 --> 00:15:01.970
Abimereki Muzaale: So there's a problem in there. Oh. any who it goes on. Use this output

132
00:15:02.770 --> 00:15:06.840
Abimereki Muzaale: noisily. Display number of deaths. This is a macro

133
00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:11.290
Abimereki Muzaale: that holds the number of observations in the data set

134
00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:26.830
Abimereki Muzaale: at this point is 3 observations in the data set. And why are they 3 instead of 5 million or so. We'll understand later, and number of observations 2. And we can see 3 observations, 2 variables.

135
00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:31.730
Abimereki Muzaale: But that's because we preserved the data set

136
00:15:31.950 --> 00:15:33.400
Abimereki Muzaale: collapsed.

137
00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:36.840
Abimereki Muzaale: counted the number of deaths by year.

138
00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:47.820
Abimereki Muzaale: So there's only 3 years. So on the 3 observations, because it collapsed everything. and you got the count of number of deaths and listed. That's the out what we're seeing here. List.

139
00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:53.540
Abimereki Muzaale: Then we created a graph based on this information here.

140
00:15:53.990 --> 00:16:00.080
Abimereki Muzaale: and that graph is right here only 3 years, because information from 1,959,

141
00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:04.440
Abimereki Muzaale: 1960, 1961, maybe it

142
00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:16.350
Abimereki Muzaale: the scatterplay. Would it be more accurate the line makes it feel like this information between you which is wrong. and I can see on the Y-axis is the numbers. So Does this look like the graph

143
00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:21.400
Abimereki Muzaale: the two-way plot that you're required to produce. Of course it does. It's 2 way

144
00:16:21.850 --> 00:16:26.000
Abimereki Muzaale: years and the x-axis. And now it does on the y-axis.

145
00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:36.410
Abimereki Muzaale: Now. all you have to do is edit this loop start from 59 to 2710 of course as you can tell

146
00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:42.750
Abimereki Muzaale: from the timers here. I must have missed here. I forgot to do this timer noisily.

147
00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:47.430
Abimereki Muzaale: Let's do timer. I'm our list.

148
00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:57.210
Abimereki Muzaale: So we can see. That it took 52 s to load you do the block of code Number 2

149
00:16:58.490 --> 00:17:03.460
Abimereki Muzaale: block of code number 2. So this is the longest block of code.

150
00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:05.730
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah.

151
00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:14.040
Abimereki Muzaale: Just trying to collapse is that it can read better.

152
00:17:15.390 --> 00:17:27.040
Abimereki Muzaale: So it's 2, the timer on loop, and import the importing of the data that you the most time a minute. So that gives you a sense that if it takes a minute.

153
00:17:27.079 --> 00:17:29.400
Abimereki Muzaale: But this my Internet, speed July.

154
00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:34.470
Abimereki Muzaale: an upload of data of 3 3 years in a minute.

155
00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:37.090
Abimereki Muzaale: So you can do a crude calculation

156
00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:40.490
Abimereki Muzaale: of how long it might take you to log from

157
00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:42.090
Abimereki Muzaale: 2,017

158
00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:49.710
Abimereki Muzaale: to from 1,517 there's. A 58 data sets right.

159
00:17:51.130 --> 00:17:52.440
Abimereki Muzaale: So

160
00:17:56.730 --> 00:18:00.090
Abimereki Muzaale: if one data set is taking about

161
00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:09.570
Abimereki Muzaale: taking about 52 divided by 3 s. this one data set

162
00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:18.960
Abimereki Muzaale: 58 data sets. This is courage, but it gives you a bulp. It's about a 1,000 s. Of course the data sets are going to get larger with time and may take longer.

163
00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:25.300
Abimereki Muzaale: Bye. we need. It starts from summer, our crew calculation from somewhere.

164
00:18:25.530 --> 00:18:35.520
Abimereki Muzaale: So to get this in the sense of minutes, you can take 7 10 min, so maybe make grab a make, a cup of coffee or warm water, or something.

165
00:18:35.610 --> 00:18:40.570
Abimereki Muzaale: Oh, you know, may maybe get something to watch and take the while this goes on

166
00:18:41.810 --> 00:18:46.880
for the 16 min. You can't be staring at data waiting for results for 16 min.

167
00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:52.670
Abimereki Muzaale: and that's just the crude estimates, probably more than that, because, as you can see.

168
00:18:55.750 --> 00:18:57.990
Abimereki Muzaale: the number of deaths increase.

169
00:18:59.410 --> 00:19:00.930
Abimereki Muzaale: they do increase.

170
00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:04.680
Abimereki Muzaale: So it's so. This data sets a much smaller.

171
00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:15.760
Abimereki Muzaale: almost twice the size here. So this is a very conservative estimate of how long it's gonna take. Yeah, let's just say it's gonna take twice the time.

172
00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:25.330
Abimereki Muzaale: and that' be through this half an hour. Okay. So the issues of time. if you move to the syllabus.

173
00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:30.170
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah. it is a runtime.

174
00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:43.640
Abimereki Muzaale: The other issue that we kind of took about until you're successful, or until you failed is memory. Some of your programs may crash. They just can't handle the number of observations.

175
00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:47.640
Abimereki Muzaale: because here we only run 3 years in where I

176
00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:50.730
Abimereki Muzaale: sympathize.

177
00:19:51.810 --> 00:19:55.950
Abimereki Muzaale: or if I say. display cn

178
00:19:58.550 --> 00:20:00.010
Abimereki Muzaale: look, we 5 million.

179
00:20:00.670 --> 00:20:08.350
Abimereki Muzaale: so that's gonna grow. as you see, exponentially every decade. And so

180
00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:16.840
Abimereki Muzaale: probably your computer will crash it. Your computer is stated. And that's the point when I see the limits and then try to build the features around that.

181
00:20:17.950 --> 00:20:26.510
Abimereki Muzaale: So you'll need Jason a Monday if you have any questions about this homework. I've pretty much given you the clue to the general issue of hand.

182
00:20:27.870 --> 00:20:34.490
Abimereki Muzaale: and and so let's see how this goes. Looking forward to seeing you, or hearing from your discussion from.

183
00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:37.570
Abimereki Muzaale: I was singing in Tuesday. bye, bye.
