# program define

Let's recap what we've covered thus far:

1. dofiles
2. macros
3. programs

If you replace the `quietly {` line of code in your .do file structure with `program define name` and the `}` with `end` you'd have written your very first program!

Can you apply this **hint** to the script used to assign you by [last name](https://jhustata.github.io/book/aaa.html) to a TA? Write a program called `tokenize` that outputs a `.log file` that offers a user some output to achieve the purpose of the tokenize script.

Now you have successfully written your first program. Its now a Stata command; however, its role is highly specific.

How may we generalize its function and tailor it to user-defined needs? That is what we are going to cover ove the next 5 weeks!!
